# CTSkyWarsTools
A ChatTrigger with various tools that come in handy when playing SkyWars

> By LifelessNerd

Open the config using /swt or /swtools

### Features
This mod consist of the following modules:
- SkyWars Levels

    *Show player level on scoreboard, and in chat when the game starts, also provides the command /swlevel \<name>*
- Autododge

    *Add map names to a list to automatically dodge*
- EXP Display

    *Show the EXP you get in games before they end, or after you've died*

## Options
Type /swt or /swtools to get a range of options of these modules. You can enable/disable them, aswell as other module-specific options.

## Known issues
- Levels might appear double, and some may be missing. This is due to a combination of restrictions in ChatTriggers, as well as the time permitted to fetch these data in the pre-game.
- Autododge may not function when you are very laggy. I use the sidebar scoreboard to get the map name, which in some cases can take very long to load. If this is the case, please add an Issue on Github, and I will try to find a workaround.
